# personal portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a web application displaying my portfolio of work for potential employers.

It contains images of, and links to, my portfolio work, as well as an about me section and how potential employers can contact me.

This project taught me how to use advanced css styling, such as grid layout, flex boxes and media queries to format my page in a way that is visually appealing on large and small devices.
